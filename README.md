### About
This is a group project designed to display recent movies. A user can view 20 recent movies. Each movie has a heart button to favorite it. If a user tries to favorite a movie before they are logged in they are prompted to sign up or log in.
This application is built using React and Redux with Router to manage pages. The backend is provided by the Turing School and can be found [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/movie-tracker) with instructions on how to run the server.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find information on common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

Data comes from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
